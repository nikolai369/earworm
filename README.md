# 👂🏻🐛 Earworm

A small experimental project to **learn Rust** and explore **audio fingerprinting** using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.

---

## 🚀 Goal

Build a basic system that can analyze audio files, extract their frequency features via FFT, and experiment with simple fingerprinting or matching techniques — all while getting comfortable with Rust’s syntax, tooling, and ecosystem.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- 📦 Rust fundamentals: ownership, lifetimes, modules, error handling
- 🔊 Audio decoding and signal processing
- ⚡ Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- 🧬 Audio fingerprinting concepts (Shazam-style matching)
- 🧰 Rust libraries like:
  - [`hound`](https://crates.io/crates/hound) – reading `.wav` files
  - [`rustfft`](https://crates.io/crates/rustfft) – FFT processing
  - [`cpal` or `rodio`](https://crates.io/crates/rodio) – optional audio playback
